    <p>Pizza[a][1] is an Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with
        tomato,
        cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.

        The term pizza was first recorded in 997 AD, in a Latin manuscript from the southern Italian town of Gaeta, in
        Lazio, on
        the border with Campania. Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating the modern pizza in
        Naples. In
        2009, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG)
        dish. In
        2017, the art of making Neapolitan pizza was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.[8]

        Pizza and its variants are among the most popular foods in the world. Pizza is sold at a variety of restaurants,
        including pizzerias (pizza specialty restaurants), Mediterranean restaurants, via delivery, and as street
        food.[9] In
        Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and
        fork.In
        casual settings, however, it is typically cut into slices to be eaten while held in the hand. Pizza is also sold
        in
        grocery stores in a variety of forms, including frozen or as kits for self-assembly. Store-bought pizzas are
        then cooked
        using a home oven.

        In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000
        pizzerias.
        Overall, 13% of the US population aged two years and over consumed pizza on any given day.</p>

    <p><img src="download.jpeg" style="width:170px;height:170px;float:left; margin-left: 15px;" The oldest recorded
            usage of the word pizza is thought to be from May 997 CE, appearing in the Codex diplomaticus Caietanus, a
            notarial Latin document from the town of Gaeta, then still part of the Byzantine Empire.[14] The text states
            that a tenant of certain property is to give the bishop of Gaeta duodecim pizze (lit. 'twelve pizzas'),[15]
            a pork shoulder and kidney annually on Christmas Day, and twelve pizzas and a couple of chickens annually on
            Easter Sunday.[16] Suggested etymologies include: Byzantine Greek and Late Latin pitta> pizza, cf. Modern
        Greek pitta bread and the Apulia and Calabrian (then Byzantine Italy) pitta,[17] a round flat bread baked in the
        oven at high temperature sometimes with toppings. The word pitta can in turn be traced to either Ancient Greek
        πικτή (pikte), 'fermented pastry', which in Latin became picta, or Ancient Greek πίσσα (pissa, Attic: πίττα,
        pitta), 'pitch',[18][19] or πήτεα (pḗtea), 'bran' (πητίτης, pētítēs, 'bran bread').[20]
        The Etymological Dictionary of the Italian Language explains it as coming from dialectal pinza, 'clamp', as in
        modern Italian pinze, 'pliers, pincers, tongs, forceps'. Their origin is from Latin pinsere, 'to pound,
        stamp'.[21]
        The Lombardic word bizzo or pizzo, meaning 'mouthful' (related to the English words bit and bite), which was
        brought to Italy in the middle of the 6th century AD by the invading Lombards.[2][22] The shift b→p could be
        explained by the High German consonant shift, and it has been noted in this connection that in German the word
        Imbiss means 'snack'.
        A small pizza is sometimes called pizzetta.[23] A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo
